# Memory Management Improvements for ImAged

## Problem Description
The application was experiencing memory leaks when opening and closing image windows. Each time an image was opened, the memory usage would increase, but it wouldn't decrease when the window was closed, leading to continuously rising memory consumption.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **BitmapSource objects not being properly disposed** when ImageViewWindow closes
2. **GDI handles not being cleaned up** after creating BitmapSource from image bytes
3. **No explicit memory cleanup** when windows are closed
4. **Missing IDisposable implementation** for ImageViewWindow

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ImageViewWindow Memory Management
- **Added IDisposable interface** to ImageViewWindow
- **Implemented Dispose method** that:
  - Clears the image source from UI elements
  - Properly disposes WriteableBitmap objects
  - Clears image references
  - Forces garbage collection
- **Added automatic disposal** when window closes
- **Added IsDisposed property** for external cleanup checks

### 2. SecureProcessManager Improvements
- **Enhanced ConvertBytesToBitmapSourceGdi method**:
  - Added explicit GDI handle cleanup
  - Clear original image bytes after conversion
  - Freeze BitmapSource for better performance
- **Added ForceMemoryCleanup method** for explicit memory cleanup

### 3. HomeViewModel Enhancements
- **Improved OnImageViewWindowClosed method**:
  - Ensures proper disposal of closed windows
  - Forces garbage collection after window closure
- **Enhanced ForceSecureMemoryCleanup method**:
  - Calls SecureProcessManager cleanup
  - More aggressive memory cleanup
- **Added memory monitoring**:
  - Checks memory usage every second
  - Automatically forces cleanup if memory usage exceeds 500MB

### 4. Memory Cleanup Strategy
- **Immediate cleanup** when windows close
- **Periodic memory monitoring** and cleanup
- **Explicit GDI handle cleanup** to prevent Windows resource leaks
- **Aggressive garbage collection** when needed

## Technical Details

### ImageViewWindow.Dispose()
```csharp
public void Dispose()
{
    if (_disposed) return;
    _disposed = true;

    try
    {
        // Clear UI image source
        if (FullImage != null)
        {
            FullImage.Source = null;
        }

        // Handle WriteableBitmap cleanup
        if (_currentImage is WriteableBitmap writeableBitmap)
        {
            // Clear pixels and unlock
            writeableBitmap.Lock();
            var pixels = new byte[writeableBitmap.PixelWidth * writeableBitmap.PixelHeight * 4];
            writeableBitmap.WritePixels(/* ... */);
            writeableBitmap.Unlock();
        }

        _currentImage = null;
        GC.Collect();
        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
    }
    catch { /* Ignore errors during cleanup */ }
}
```

### Memory Monitoring
```csharp
private void CheckMemoryUsageAndCleanup()
{
    var currentProcess = System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess();
    var memoryUsageMB = currentProcess.WorkingSet64 / 1024 / 1024;
    
    if (memoryUsageMB > 500)
    {
        ForceSecureMemoryCleanup();
    }
}
```

## Expected Results
- **Memory usage should decrease** when image windows are closed
- **No more continuous memory growth** during normal usage
- **Better performance** due to reduced memory pressure
- **Automatic cleanup** when memory usage gets too high

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open multiple large images
2. Close them one by one
3. Monitor memory usage in Task Manager
4. Verify memory returns to baseline levels
5. Test with very large images (>10MB)
6. Test rapid open/close operations

## Additional Notes
- The cleanup is designed to be safe and won't crash the application
- Garbage collection is forced only when necessary
- All cleanup operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Memory monitoring runs every second but only forces cleanup when needed
